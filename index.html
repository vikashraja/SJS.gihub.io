        <h2>Mission and Vision</h2>
        <p id="p1">Our objective and mission for this project is simple yet very urgent, to make clean water available in places where it's hard to get. We want to help underprivileged communities by providing them access to affordable water purification systems that are easy to use.
        <br>
        <br>
        We envision a healthier world where everyone has access to clean and affordable drinking water. By doing this, we aim to positively impact the lives of those in disadvantaged communities by addressing their fundamental need for clean water.
        <br>
        <br>
        We also want to involve local authorities in setting up and taking care of these purifiers. This way, the community will own them and keep them working for a long time. And we plan to use methods that are good for the environment, that do not create too much waste or use up too much energy.
        <br>
        <br>

        Indirectly, our efforts will also help protect the environment by using eco-friendly purification techniques, reducing waste, and conserving energy.
        <br>
        <br>
        In short, our mission is to help underprivilaged people acquire clean water in a way that's good for them and the Earth. This will make their lives better and protect nature.</p>
